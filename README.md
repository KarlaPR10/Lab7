Integrating Design Patterns in a Project Scenario
  Tasks
    Design Problem Solving:
    Scenario Description: Participants are provided with a series of common software design challenges. They will need to choose appropriate design patterns to solve these specific problems effectively.
      Design Challenges:
        Global Configuration Management: 
        Design a system that ensures a single, globally accessible configuration object without access conflicts.

        Dynamic Object Creation Based on User Input: Implement a system to dynamically create various types of user interface elements based on user actions.
        State Change Notification Across System Components: Ensure components are notified about changes in the state of other parts without creating tight coupling.
        Efficient Management of Asynchronous Operations: Manage multiple asynchronous operations like API calls which need to be coordinated without blocking the main application workflow.
    Task: Outline solutions that integrate these patterns into a cohesive design to address the challenges.
  Project Execution Simulation:
  Simulate the application of these patterns in a hypothetical software project. Document the approach, rationale, and integration process of the chosen patterns as they apply to the design challenges.
