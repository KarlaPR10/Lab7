Integrating Design Patterns in a Project Scenario
  Tasks
    Design Problem Solving:
    Scenario Description: Participants are provided with a series of common software design challenges. They will need to choose appropriate design patterns to solve these specific problems effectively.
      Design Challenges:
        Global Configuration Management: 
        Design a system that ensures a single, globally accessible configuration object without access conflicts.

        Patrón Singleton
        Se aplica el patron singleton dando un ejemplo de configuración el creo se opto porque es el adecuado que emular un patron singleton.

 State Change Notification Across System Components: Ensure components are notified about changes in the state of other parts without creating tight coupling.
        Efficient Management of Asynchronous Operations: Manage multiple asynchronous operations like API calls which need to be coordinated without blocking the main application workflow.
    Task: Outline solutions that integrate these patterns into a cohesive design to address the challenges.
  Project Execution Simulation:
  Simulate the application of these patterns in a hypothetical software project. Document the approach, rationale, and integration process of the chosen patterns as they apply to the design challenges.
